# Shelf.page ðŸª‚

I used to keep a list of some of my favorite reads online and share it on Twitter, but keeping it updated became a chore, and I wanted a more beautiful place to share my favorite reads online.

So I made shelf.page! It's your online, public bookshelf, blog-shelf, newsletter-shelf, anything-else-you're-reading-shelf.

Here's mine, at [shelf.page/thesephist](https://shelf.page/thesephist).

## Built with Remake

Shelf.page was my first project in [Remake](https://remaketheweb.com/), a web app framework that makes prototyping projects lightning fast.

I've written a blog post about my experience with Remake [here](#).

Shelf.page also owes its visual style to [blocks.css](https://thesephist.github.io/blocks.css/), a simple CSS library for the "blocky" aesthetic of Shelf.page.
