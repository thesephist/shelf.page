        <p>Hey there! I'm Linus.</p>
        <p>
        I used to keep a
        <a href="https://linus.zone/technical-reading">list of some of my favorite reads online</a>
        and share it on Twitter, but keeping it updated became a chore, and I
        wanted a more beautiful place to share my favorite reads online.
        </p>
        <p>
        So I made <strong>shelf.page</strong>! It's your online, public bookshelf,
        blog-shelf, newsletter-shelf, anything-else-you're-reading-shelf. Here's
        mine:
        </p>
        <a class="block" href="/thesephist">Check out my shelf.page &rarr;</a>

        <h2>But why?</h2>
        <p>
        I used to love visiting friends and seeing what was on their
        bookshelves. Scanning the books and magazines and old newspaper
        clippings on a bokshelf is such a unique way of understanding how
        someone thinks, and what's on their mind.
        </p>
        <p>
        These days we're all bustling curators online. We send and share links
        and recommendations <em>all the time</em>. But we rarely get to look at
        others' shelves in the same way.  <strong>Shelf.page</strong> is an
        attempt to revive that feeling, online.
