# Assets

This directory contains all your front-end assets.

* CSS
* Images
* JavaScript

E.g. If you include an image called `my-picture.png` in the root of this directory, it will be available at `https://your-app.com/my-picture.png`

# Tips

* Each JS file is transpiled and minified into its own file
* Remake uses Sass instead of regular CSS (https://sass-lang.com/)
* Sass and JS files that start with an underscore (i.e. `_`) are treated as partial file and can be included by other Sass and JS files without being processed themselves
