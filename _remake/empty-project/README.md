# Hi, welcome to your Remake app! 😁

This "app" directory is where all the code for your app will live.

# Start with an empty project! 🎨

When you first create a Remake project, it comes with the default Trello clone already set up.

If you want to start from scratch with an empty project:

1. Find the directory `/your-remake-app/_remake/empty-project`
2. Copy all the files and directories from that directory into the the following directory: `/your-remake-app/app`
3. This will replace the Trello clone app and give you a fresh start! 🎉
