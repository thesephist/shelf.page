The Remake framework code is in this directory.

*You should never have to edit files in this directory*

Feel free to explore:
* The client-side Remake framework lives in `/_remake/client-side` and is compiled into `/_remake/dist`
* Back-end code lives in every other file in this directory (besides `/_remake/empty-project`). 
  * You can trace its beginning from `/_remake/main.js` and go from there! 🚴‍♀️
