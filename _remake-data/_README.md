This is where your app's data for each user lives.

Each user gets two JSON files associated with them:
- In `/_remake-data/user-app-data` you'll find a JSON file matching each user's username that stores the data they've created using your app
- In `/_remake-data/user-details` you'll find a JSON file matching each user's username that stores their login details, like their username and email address
